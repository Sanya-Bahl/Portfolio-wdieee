                        <h2>
                            Alarm clock
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            This beginner-level Python project is quite practical since almost everyone uses an alarm clock on a daily basis. The project is a CLI(Command Line Interface) application with a unique twist. Apart from the standard alarm clock features like clock, alarm, stopwatch, and timer, this alarm clock has YouTube integration. You can include YouTube links in a text file and code the application to read the file. So, when you set a time for an alarm, the app will choose a random YouTube link stored in the text file and start playing the video.

                    <div class="card">
                        <img src="E:\Visual2019\Respo\Project\Images/address book.png" "  />
                        <h2>
                            Address book
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The address book project is a pretty simple GUI application wherein users can add multiple contact details, displaying them in a list format. Users can add and store contact details like name, contact number, and address. To add new contact information, a user needs to type the desired information in the text fields and click on the add button to add the record. They can also delete any contact record that they no longer need. The three core components for this Python final year project are AddressBook.py, db.py, and gui.py.

                        <h2>
                            Currency converter
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Another GUI application in the list, this project involves building a currency converter that can convert one currency’s value into another currency unit. For instance, you can convert the Indian rupee into dollar or pound and vice versa. The challenge that lies here is that the value of currencies fluctuates daily. However, you can solve this issue by importing an excel spreadsheet containing the updated currency values. To build this project, you must have the basic knowledge of python programming and the Pygame library.
